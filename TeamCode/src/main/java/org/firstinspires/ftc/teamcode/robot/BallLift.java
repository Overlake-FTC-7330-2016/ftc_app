    *NOTE: need to make this use the DcMotorServo class to allow success
    Ball Lifter:
        In Autonomous:
            Not running at all
        In TeleOp:
            Running constantly with the pattern:
                run until abosolute position of X, then pause for 1 sec
                then continue until abolute position is X again
            Driver can manually stop the Ball lifter by the press of a button, maybe not for first competition.
